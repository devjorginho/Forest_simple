## About

This is a simple game developed as a study project to learn game development concepts such as physics (gravity, velocity) and the Entity-Component-System architecture.

Gained experience with the ECS, implementing entities and components in C. Improved understanding of game physics systems and deepened my knowledge of low-level memory manipulation.
## How to Run

To build and run the game, just run:

```bash
make
./so_long
